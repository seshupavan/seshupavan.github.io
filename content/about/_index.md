I have nearly 1 year of experience working as a product engineer at a deep-tech startup that developed a speech therapy application for stuttering and other speech disorders. My role includes working on user experience, product research, design & development, collaborating with our team and healthcare providers to formulate technological solutions, and evaluating machine learning models for their practical use cases.

The transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare is something I strongly believe in, especially for detection, diagnosis and enhancing communication between patients and healthcare providers. To explore these possibilities further, I actively participate in the [MEXA community](https://mexa.app/), engaging in collaborative projects and hackathons focused on Generative AI in mental healthcare.

I enjoy contributing to open science initiatives. The [Community Computer Vision Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/computer-vision-course/en/unit0/welcome/welcome#meet-our-team) I co-authored for Hugging Face is being read by thousands of people. Our proposed solution for better diagnosing mental health using a multimodal approach—incorporating text, speech, and video—won 3rd prize out of 22 teams in a hackathon.

Beyond technology, I enjoy reading books, playing badminton, gardening, and pursuing anything that sparks my curiosity and amazement.
